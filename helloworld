hello git!
Creating a new branck is quick.
Modified something in master branch.
Make some work in dev branch.
Let me try to use fast forward to merge.
reset HEAD will not modify workspace?
if i do not commit, can i create a new branch?
in new branch work something but no commit, may pollute all branch git status.
